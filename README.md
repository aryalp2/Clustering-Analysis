# Clustering-Analysis
cluster analysis, a category of unsupervised learning techniques that allows us to discover hidden structures in data where we do not know the right answer upfront. 
The goal of clustering is to find a natural grouping in data so that items in the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those from different clusters.
Here we will Find centers of similarity using the popular k-means algorithm,
Take a bottom-up approach to building hierarchical clustering trees and
Identify arbitrary shapes of objects using a density-based clustering
approach
